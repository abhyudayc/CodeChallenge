A security company needs codebreaker game which counts number of turn taking to break a
randomly generated numeric code, for their research.


Rules laid down for the process are:

1. System generates a random three digit numeric code "xxx"
2. User who is taking guesses has too much above code "xxx" to end the game.
3. Every time the user takes a guess "g" system returns of cryptic message "m" which is encoded for "xxx".
4. Encoding "xxx" is done by replacing digits with placeholders as follows:
	>> Literal 'X' for every digit which is not in the guess.
	>> Literal 'P' for every digit which is in the gas but not in correct place.
	>> Literal 'M' for every digit which is both present and in correct place.
5. Finally you have to output number of turns needed for cracking the code.


Example:

Let's assume system generated code "xxx" is 573
*guess is user input, and the cryptic message is output

guess 1 : 156
cryptic message: PXX

guess 2 : 123
cryptic message: XXM

guess 3 : 953
cryptic message: PXM

guess 4 : 543
cryptic message: MXM

guess 5 : 573
cryptic message: MMM

final output : 5
